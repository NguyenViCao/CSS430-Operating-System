Language: C++
This assignment implements your own malloc( ) and free( ) using the “sbrk” system function: change data segment 
size. Your implementation is based on the first-fit and the best-fit strategies. Since the original malloc/free functions 
in  Linux  use  “brk”  (an  even  more  legacy  function  than  sbrk),  you  can  compare  your  own  and  the  Linux-original 
implementations in terms of # brk system function calls. (The few calls the better memory allocations.)
