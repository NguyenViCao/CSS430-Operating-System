Language: JAVA
This assignment exercises an implementation of Java monitors. While the original Java monitors have only an 
ability  of  randomly  waking  up  one  or  all  sleeping  threads, the  implementation  of  Java  monitor  in  this 
assignment  allows  threads  to  sleep on  and  wake  up  from  a  different  condition  specified  as  an  integer.  Using 
this special monitor in SynchQueue.java, you will implement SysLib.wait( ) and SysLib.exit( ) system calls, with 
which a parent thread can wait for one of its child threads to be terminated.
